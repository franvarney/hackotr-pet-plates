# Pet Plates

This is a winning hack from [The Brandery](http://brandery.org/)'s first hackathon, [HackOTR](http://www.hackotr.com/).

Pet Plates is a site for pet owners to submit and share their favorite pet recipes and was created by myself, [Jordan Crone](https://github.com/jordantheleast), and Harry Kran-Annexstein.

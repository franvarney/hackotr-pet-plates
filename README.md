# Pet Plates

This is a winning hack from [The Brandery](http://brandery.org/)'s first hackathon, [HackOTR](http://www.hackotr.com/).

Pet Plates is a site for pet owners to submit and share their favorite pet recipes and was created by myself, [Jordan Crone](https://github.com/jordantheleast), and Harry Kran-Annexstein.

**Soapbox Media**, [_The Brandery's HackOTR debut deemed a success_](https://www.soapboxmedia.com/innovationnews/031015-brandery-hack-OTR-deemed-a-success.aspx) said: 
> Petbrosia, another well-established Cincinnati startup, selected Pet Plates as its favorite “side hack.” That team put together a dog food recipe compilation site, much like Allrecipes.com for pet owners.
